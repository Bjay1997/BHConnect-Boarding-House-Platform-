Project Title
BHConnect â€“ A modern boarding house listing and booking platform.

Description
BHConnect is a full-stack web platform built using FastAPI (Python) for the backend and React (JavaScript, via Vite) for the frontend. It allows property owners to register, list and manage their boarding houses, and handle tenant bookings. Tenants can view listings, filter by location or price, favorite properties, book stays, and leave reviews. Admin functionality is also included for managing users and listings. The platform is designed to be responsive, scalable, and user-friendly.
